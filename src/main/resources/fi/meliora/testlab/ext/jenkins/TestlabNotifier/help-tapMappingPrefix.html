        When mapping test results to test cases in Testlab test cases are set with a mapping

        For example, when this option is entered with value "automated." and the tests are in a file named as "my-tests.tap" the mapping
        identifiers for
    </p>
    <pre>
        1..2
        ok 1 first test
        not ok 2 second test
    </pre>
    <p>
        are structured as follows (Include TAP file name in mapping identifier: Yes, Include test number from mapping identifier: No):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>automated.my-tests_tap.first test</li>
        <li>automated.my-tests_tap.second test</li>
