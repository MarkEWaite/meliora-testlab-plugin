        The results of TAP tests are parsed from .tap files (for example, "my-tests.tap"). If this option is checked,
        the mapping identifier Testlab will use to map the TAP tests to Testlab's test cases will include the name
        of the TAP file as a prefix with all dots replaced with underscore characters.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, when this option is checked and the tests are in a file named as "my-tests.tap" the mapping
        identifiers are structured as follows (Include test number from mapping identifier: No):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>my-tests_tap.first test</li>
        <li>my-tests_tap.second test</li>
        <li>...</li>
    </ul>
