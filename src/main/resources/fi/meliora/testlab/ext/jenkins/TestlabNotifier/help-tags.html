<div>
    <p>
        Tags to be set for the Testlab test run.
    </p>
    <p>
        Separate multiple tags with spaces. For example, if you would like to tag the test run
        with tags <b>jenkins</b> and <b>integration</b>, enter a value for this setting as 'jenkins integration'.
        When updating runs, if the job sends even one tag all existing tags in the run will be replaced. Leaving
        this field blank leaves the tags at Testlab side untouched.
