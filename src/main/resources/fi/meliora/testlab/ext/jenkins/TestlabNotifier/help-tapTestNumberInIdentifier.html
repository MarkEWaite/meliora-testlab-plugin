        For example, when this option is checked and the tests are in a file named as "my-tests.tap" the mapping
        identifiers for
        <pre>
            1..2
            ok 1 first test
            not ok 2 second test
        </pre>
        are structured as follows (Include TAP file name in mapping identifier: Yes):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>my-tests_tap.1 first test</li>
        <li>my-tests_tap.2 second test</li>
