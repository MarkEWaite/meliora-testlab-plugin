        Title of the Testlab's custom field to use to map the test cases to unit test methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make it possible to push unit test results from Jenkins to Testlab the
        unit test class.method name must be mapped to a test case in your Testlab project:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Configure a new "text" custom field to your project at Testlab side. Give
            the field a human readable title such as "JUnit test".
        </li>
        <li>
            Update your test cases at Testlab side and enter proper JUnit test
            class+method name pairs for your test cases.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enter "JUnit test" to this field at Jenkins side. This way when
            unit tests in Jenkins fail they will be mapped to test cases with
            matching "JUnit test" names at Testlab side. When importing Testlab
            will peek the set custom field of a test case and if it matches the class.method name
            of a failed unit test the test case will be marked as failed.
        </li>
    </ol>
