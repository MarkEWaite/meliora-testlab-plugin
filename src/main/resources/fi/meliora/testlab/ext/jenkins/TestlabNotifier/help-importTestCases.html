        If set, when publishing the testing results to Testlab the test cases will be
        automatically created to the Testlab project if they are missing. A missing test case
        is a one which is not found via the mapping identifier constructed for the automated test.
    </p>
    <p>
        Test cases will be imported to test categories according to the mapping
        identifier (see "Test case mapping field").
        For example, if the mapping identifier constructed for the test is "com.mycompany.SomeTest",
        and a test case is not found mapped to this identifier, a test case named "SomeTest" will be
        created to
    </p>
    <pre>
        Import/com/mycompany
    </pre>
    <p>
        .. category.
