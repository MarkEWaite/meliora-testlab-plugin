        The plugin supports publishing the results from TAP (<i><a target="_blank" href="https://testanything.org/tap-specification.html">Test Anything Protocol</a></i>)
        files found in the build. If not checked, the possible TAP results produced by the job are ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            To publish TAP results the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TAP+Plugin" target="_blank">TAP-Plugin</a> must be installed
            to your Jenkins. In addition to this, the job must be configured with "Publish TAP Results" Post-build Action to make the results
            available for publishing.
