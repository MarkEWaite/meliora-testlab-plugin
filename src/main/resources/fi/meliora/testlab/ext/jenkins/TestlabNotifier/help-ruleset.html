        A "ruleset" is a set of settings and mapping rules defined in Testlab. Enter a name
        of the ruleset you wish to use for processing the pushed results. If you wish
        to override a setting (or settings) in your job, choose the "Override ruleset settings"
        option and set the preferred values.

        <i>If not set, the default ruleset in your Testlab will be used.</i>
