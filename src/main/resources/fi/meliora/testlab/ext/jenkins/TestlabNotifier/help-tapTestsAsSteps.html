        By default, this plugin will publish and map each test line in a TAP file to a test case
        in Testlab.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, when the tests are in a file named as "my-tests.tap"
        (Include TAP file name in mapping identifier: Yes, Include test number from mapping identifier: No) as:
    </p>
        <pre>
            1..2
            ok 1 first test
            not ok 2 second test
        </pre>
    <p>
        .. the tests will be mapped in Testlab to test cases as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>my-tests_tap.first test => mapped to a first test case</li>
        <li>my-tests_tap.second test => mapped to a second test case</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When this option is checked, only the TAP file will be mapped to a test case in Testlab
        and each test line in the file will be imported as an execution step to these test cases.
        With the set up exampled above, the tests will be mapped in Testlab to test cases as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>my-tests_tap => mapped to a test case</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        .. and the execution steps of the test case will be overwritten with the test lines from the TAP file.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Please note, that
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            the publish will overwrite and replace all execution steps in the mapped test case,
        </li>
        <li>
            the steps will be updated ONLY for the test case with exact mapping
            (in the above example in Testlab, a test case with mapping identifier "my-tests_tap" must exist),
        </li>
        <li>
            the testing result of the test case is set as failed if one or more test lines in the TAP
            file are reported as NOT OK and
        </li>
        <li>
            reporting-wise in Testlab, only the result of the test case matters. Execution results
            of the individual steps are only informational.
        </li>
    </ul>
