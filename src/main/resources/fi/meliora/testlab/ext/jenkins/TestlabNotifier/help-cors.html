        If your Jenkins is using security (which it should) and you'd prefer to your
        Testlab users to be able to use Jenkins Jobs widget to see Jenkins' jobs and
        build them, you should enable this option and setup the origin domain(s).
    </p>
    <p>
        When enabling this setting:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Jenkins responses will be injected with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">CORS</a>
            HTTP headers which tell the browser to allow calls from Testlab to Jenkins' API.
            <i>If your Jenkins is behind a proxy, make sure your proxy is configured to work
                with CORS enabled Jenkins. This means, that your proxy should pass though
                Jenkins sent "Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "Access-Control-Allow-Methods",
                "Access-Control-Allow-Headers" and "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" response
                headers to Testlab, and Testlab sent "Origin", "Authorization" and ".crumb" headers to Jenkins.
            </i>
        </li>
        <li>
            You should configure the Origins setting to a full URL origin address of your
            Testlab such as 'http://mytestlab.melioratestlab.com'. This restricts the
            CORS calls to only be allowed from this host. If you need to set multiple values
            separate values with a comma. If set to a wildcard value '*'
            the calls will work but the CORS calls will be allowed from any domain which
            is not recommended for security reasons.
        </li>
    </ul>
