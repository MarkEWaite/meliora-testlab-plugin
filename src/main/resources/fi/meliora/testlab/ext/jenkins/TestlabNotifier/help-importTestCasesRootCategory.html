        By default the test cases will be automatically created to test category "Import".
        By setting this value the root category where the test cases will be created to
        can be configured.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if the mapping identifier constructed for the test is "com.mycompany.SomeTest",
        and this setting is set as "Some/Category/Path", a test case named "SomeTest" will be
        created to
    </p>
    <pre>
        Some/Category/Path/com/mycompany
    </pre>
    <p>
        .. category.
    </p>
