<div>
    <p>
        If set, all keywords and their sub keywords are catenated to a single step in the result when possible. For example:
        <br>
        <pre>
        &lt;kw name='Open site'&gt;
            &lt;kw name='Open URL'&gt;
                &lt;kw name='Navigate browser'&gt;
                ...
                &lt;/kw&gt;
            &lt;/kw&gt;
        &lt;/kw&gt;
        ...
        </pre>
        <br>
        .. the test case result is added with a single step described as 'Open site - Open URL - Navigate browser'.
        Note that when concatenating and a step fails it is always included as a separate step.
    </p>
    <p>
        If not set, each sub keyword will generate a separate step to the result.
